INTRODUCTION :

javascript is a functional programming language . 
javascript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updated content multimedia , animate images and much more .
in HTML , Javascript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags
usually we are making different file(script) for the javascript but we also write in html file 

style written at first and script written at the end .


**Variables in javascript
    variables are containers for storing data we can declare a variable by using these keywords 
    .. using let(mutable) for declaring block-scoped variable(new),in future we also change the value inside the let container 

    ..using const for declaring constant variables,usually prefer to use const because it has less chances to give error bcz we can't change the value in future . 


**Rules for writing variable names 
.. variable names must start with either a letter , an underscore _ or the dollar sign $
.. variable names cannot start with numbers 
.. javascript is case-sensitive 
..keywords cannot be used as variable names 

**Data Types:
    define:a datatype in programming is a classification that specifies which type of a variable has and what type of mathematical , relational or logical operations can be apllied to it without causing an error 
    a. String:
    b.Number:
    c.Boolean:
    d.Undefined:
    e.Object:


    Javascript Type Conversion :
    //1. javascript considers 0 as false and all non-zero numbers as true and if true is converted to a number the result is converted to a number the result is always 1 .
    //2. String() takes null and undefined and converts them to string 
    //3. in javascript undefined , null, 0, NaN converts to false . all other values give true .
